  - [ ] Commands execute without errors

### 3. Debug Session Integration
**Test Scenario**: Start Flutter debugging session (F5)

- [ ] **Breakpoint Integration**
  - [ ] Set breakpoint in error-prone code
  - [ ] When breakpoint hits with exception, "ü§ñ Fix Exception" button appears
  - [ ] Button sends exception context to Copilot Chat
  - [ ] Exception details include variable values and call stack

- [ ] **Debug Console Monitoring**
  - [ ] Extension monitors debug console output
  - [ ] Flutter errors in console trigger notifications
  - [ ] Console errors can be sent to AI with one click

### 4. Terminal Integration
**Test Scenario**: Run `flutter run` in terminal

- [ ] **Terminal Output Monitoring**
  - [ ] Extension detects errors in terminal output
  - [ ] Terminal error notifications appear
  - [ ] "ü§ñ Analyze with AI" button works from notifications

- [ ] **Real-time Error Streaming**
  - [ ] Errors are detected as they occur
  - [ ] No significant delay between error and detection
  - [ ] Multiple errors can be handled simultaneously

## üîß MCP Server Integration

### Server Functionality
- [ ] **Server Startup**
  - [ ] MCP server starts on port 3000 (HTTP) and 8080 (WebSocket)
  - [ ] Server responds to health checks
  - [ ] WebSocket connections can be established

- [ ] **Error Transport**
  - [ ] Errors are sent to MCP server via WebSocket
  - [ ] Server logs show received error data
  - [ ] Error format includes all necessary context

- [ ] **MCP Tools Integration**
  - [ ] Extension declares MCP server in package.json
  - [ ] Copilot can discover and use MCP tools
  - [ ] Tools provide Flutter-specific debugging assistance

## üé® User Experience Testing

### Visual Indicators
- [ ] **Status Bar**
  - [ ] Shows "ü§ñ Flutter Debug Assistant" when active
  - [ ] Updates when errors are detected
  - [ ] Clickable for quick access to commands

- [ ] **CodeLens Appearance**
  - [ ] Buttons are visually distinct and professional
  - [ ] Icons render correctly (ü§ñ emoji)
  - [ ] Text is readable and clear

- [ ] **Notifications**
  - [ ] Error notifications are informative but not intrusive
  - [ ] Action buttons are clearly labeled
  - [ ] Notifications can be dismissed

### Performance
- [ ] **Responsiveness**
  - [ ] Extension activates quickly when Flutter files are opened
  - [ ] Error detection happens in real-time
  - [ ] UI remains responsive during error processing

- [ ] **Resource Usage**
  - [ ] Extension doesn't cause VS Code to slow down
  - [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable
  - [ ] CPU usage is minimal when idle

## üêõ Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Error Scenarios

  - [ ] Handles MCP server connection failures
  - [ ] Retries connection attempts
  - [ ] Works offline (local features only)

- [ ] **Invalid Flutter Projects**
  - [ ] Handles non-Flutter projects gracefully
  - [ ] Doesn't activate in inappropriate contexts
  - [ ] Clear messaging about Flutter requirement

### Data Validation
