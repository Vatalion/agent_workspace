## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Problem 1: Don't See Extension Commands in Command Palette**

**Check Extension Status:**
```bash
# Run this in terminal to verify installation:
"/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code" --list-extensions | grep flutter-debug
```

**Expected Output:** `flutter-debug-team.flutter-debug-assistant`

**If Not Installed:**
```bash
# Reinstall the extension:
cd /Users/vitalijsimko/workspace/projects/flutter/agent_workspace/flutter_debug_extension
"/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code" --install-extension flutter-debug-assistant-0.0.1.vsix
```

### **Problem 2: Flutter App Not Running**

**Check if App is Running:**
```bash
# Check if Flutter process exists:
ps aux | grep "flutter run"
```

**Restart Flutter App:**
```bash
cd /Users/vitalijsimko/workspace/projects/flutter/agent_workspace/test_flutter_app
flutter run
```

### **Problem 3: No Error Output in VS Code Terminal**

**Possible Causes:**
- Flutter app not connected to VS Code terminal
- Using wrong VS Code instance (Insiders vs Regular)
- Terminal not showing Flutter output

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure you're using the correct VS Code:
"/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code" /Users/vitalijsimko/workspace/projects/flutter/agent_workspace/test_flutter_app
```

### **Problem 4: Extension Commands Don't Work**

**Check Developer Console:**
```
1. In VS Code: Help ‚Üí Toggle Developer Tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any error messages when clicking extension commands
4. Share any red error messages you see
```
