# 🔧 RIGHT-CLICK MENU FIX - TEST AGAIN

## ✅ **WHAT I FIXED**

The right-click menu wasn't showing because it was configured to only appear when you had text selected. I've fixed this!

### **Changes Made:**
- ❌ **Before**: Menu only showed `when: "resourceExtname == .dart && editorHasSelection"`
- ✅ **After**: Menu shows `when: "resourceExtname == .dart"` (always in Dart files)
- ✅ **Added**: All 3 AI commands to the right-click menu
- ✅ **Reinstalled**: Fresh extension with fixed configuration
