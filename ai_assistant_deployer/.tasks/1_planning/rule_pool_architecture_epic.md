# EPIC: Rule Pool Architecture Implementation

## COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT: HIGH (60+ hours, unlimited files)
**Epic Scale**: 100-200+ hours | **Priority**: Critical | **Type**: Major Architecture Refactoring

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Current State Analysis
The current architecture has **embedded rules** directly within modes:
```
Current Architecture:
├── Mode Files (templates/modes/[mode]/copilot-instructions.md)
│   └── Contains: Rules embedded directly in content
├── Deployment Service 
│   └── Copies entire mode files with embedded rules
└── Discovery Service
    └── Parses rules from deployed mode files
```

### Target Architecture: Rule Pool System
```
New Rule Pool Architecture:
├── Core Rule Pool (src/core/rules/)
│   ├── pool/                    # Centralized rule definitions
│   │   ├── flutter-solid.rule.json      # SOLID principles
│   │   ├── clean-architecture.rule.json # Clean Architecture
│   │   ├── testing-requirements.rule.json # Testing rules
│   │   ├── backup-strategy.rule.json    # Backup rules
│   │   └── [custom-user-rules]/         # User-defined rules
│   └── management/              # Rule pool management
│       ├── RulePoolService.ts   # Core rule pool operations
│       ├── RuleValidator.ts     # Rule validation
│       └── RuleRenderer.ts      # Rule to content rendering
├── Mode Configuration (refactored)
│   ├── simplified.mode.json     # References to rules only
│   ├── enterprise.mode.json     # References to rules only
│   └── hybrid.mode.json         # References to rules only
├── Custom Mode System
│   ├── services/CustomModeService.ts    # Custom mode creation
│   ├── ui/CustomModeManager.tsx         # UI for mode creation
│   └── storage/UserModes.ts             # User mode persistence
├── Custom Rule System
│   ├── services/CustomRuleService.ts    # Custom rule creation
│   ├── ui/CustomRuleEditor.tsx          # UI for rule creation
│   └── validation/RuleSchemas.ts        # Rule validation schemas
└── UI Components
    ├── RulePoolBrowser.tsx       # Browse available rules
    ├── ModeCustomizer.tsx        # Create/edit custom modes
    └── RuleEditor.tsx           # Create/edit custom rules
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Technical Objectives
- [ ] All existing modes converted to rule pool system
- [ ] Zero breaking changes for existing users
- [ ] Custom mode creation fully functional
- [ ] Custom rule creation fully functional
- [ ] Complete UI integration
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved

### User Experience Objectives  
- [ ] Users can browse all available rules
- [ ] Users can create custom modes by selecting rules
- [ ] Users can create their own custom rules
- [ ] Users can name and organize their modes/rules
- [ ] Seamless migration from current system
- [ ] Intuitive UI for all operations

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Backup Strategy**: Full backup before any changes
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Phase-by-phase with testing
3. **Compatibility Layer**: Support both old and new systems during transition
4. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to previous system

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: All new services and components
2. **Integration Tests**: Full deployment and rule resolution
3. **User Acceptance**: Manual testing of all workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure no regression in deployment speed

## TIMELINE ESTIMATE
- **Total Duration**: 110-135 hours
- **Recommended Approach**: 3-4 week epic with daily checkpoints
- **Complexity**: HIGH - Major architectural refactoring
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Well-planned with backup strategies

## DEPENDENCIES
- Existing extension codebase
- Current template system
- VS Code webview APIs
- File system operations

## NEXT STEPS
1. Create detailed technical specifications
2. Set up development environment with backups
3. Begin Phase 1: Core Rule Pool Foundation
4. Implement incremental testing at each phase
5. Coordinate UI/UX design with technical implementation
