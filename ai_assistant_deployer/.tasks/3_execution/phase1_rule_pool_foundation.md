# TASK: Rule Pool Architecture - Phase 1 Implementation

## OBJECTIVE
Create the core Rule Pool foundation by extracting all existing rules from current modes and establishing the rule pool service architecture.

## PROGRESS TRACKING

### Phase 1.1: Rule Schema Design ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Analyze existing rule structure in modes
- [x] Design comprehensive rule JSON schema
- [x] Create rule validation system
- [x] Implement rule categorization system

### Phase 1.2: Rule Extraction ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Extract rules from Enterprise mode (24 rules)
- [x] Extract rules from Simplified mode (11 rules)
- [x] Extract rules from Hybrid mode (6 rules)
- [x] Convert rules to standardized JSON format

### Phase 1.3: Rule Pool Service ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement RulePoolService class
- [x] Create rule CRUD operations
- [x] Implement rule discovery and loading
- [x] Add rule validation and sanitization
- [x] Test integration with extracted rules (41 total rules)

### Phase 1.4: Rule Rendering Engine ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create rule-to-markdown renderer (basic)
- [x] Implement advanced template system
- [x] Build content generation pipeline
- [x] Test rendering with existing rules
- [x] Create mode-specific rendering templates
- [x] Validate template processing with all rule categories
- [x] Generate complete mode files from templates
- [x] Test custom template functionality

## CURRENT RULE ANALYSIS

Based on semantic search, I've identified the following rule categories and patterns:

### Existing Rule Categories
1. **SOLID Principles** (Enterprise/Simplified)
2. **Clean Architecture** (Enterprise/Simplified)
3. **File Practices** (Enterprise/Simplified)
4. **Testing Requirements** (Enterprise/Simplified/Hybrid)
5. **Backup Strategy** (Enterprise/Simplified/Hybrid)
6. **State Management** (Enterprise/Simplified)
7. **Performance Guidelines** (Enterprise)
8. **Task Management** (Enterprise/Simplified/Hybrid)
9. **Security Rules** (Enterprise/Simplified/Hybrid)
10. **Development Workflow** (Enterprise/Simplified/Hybrid)
11. **Refactoring Guidelines** (Enterprise)
12. **Enterprise Features** (Enterprise)
13. **Mode Switching** (All modes)

### Rule Urgency Patterns Found
- **CRITICAL**: "MUST", "NEVER", "MANDATORY", "REQUIRED"
- **HIGH**: "SHOULD", "NON-NEGOTIABLE"
- **MEDIUM**: Standard practices and guidelines
- **LOW**: Suggestions and recommendations
- **INFO**: Documentation and explanatory content

### Rule Source Files Identified
- `copilot-instructions.md` (per mode)
- `project-rules.md` (per mode)
- Shell scripts in automation folders
- System configuration files

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Step 1: Create Rule Schema
Define comprehensive JSON schema for rules that captures:
- Metadata (id, title, description, category, urgency)
- Content (markdown content, applies to, tags)
- Source information (file, section, mode)
- Validation rules and constraints

### Step 2: Extract and Convert Rules
Parse existing mode files and convert to JSON rule format:
- Use existing RuleDiscoveryService as reference
- Extract rules from all 3 modes (enterprise/simplified/hybrid)
- Generate unique IDs and proper categorization
- Maintain source traceability

### Step 3: Implement Rule Pool Service
Create service for managing the centralized rule pool:
- Load rules from JSON files
- Provide CRUD operations
- Handle rule validation and sanitization
- Support rule filtering and searching

### Step 4: Create Rendering Engine
Build system to convert rules back to markdown:
- Template-based rendering
- Mode-specific content generation
- Support for rule composition and overrides

## PHASE 1 COMPLETION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

All Phase 1 objectives achieved:
- ✅ Rule Schema Design (41 rules extracted)
- ✅ Rule Extraction Service (supports all 3 modes)
- ✅ Rule Pool Service (CRUD, search, validation, backup)
- ✅ Rule Rendering Engine (template-based mode generation)

### Next Steps: PHASE 2 - Mode Configuration Refactoring

**Objective**: Convert existing modes from embedded content to rule references

**Phase 2.1: Mode Configuration Schema** (3-5 hours)
- [ ] Design mode configuration JSON schema
- [ ] Create mode configuration validation
- [ ] Build mode configuration parser
- [ ] Test configuration loading and validation

**Phase 2.2: Mode File Conversion** (8-12 hours)
- [ ] Convert enterprise mode to rule references
- [ ] Convert simplified mode to rule references  
- [ ] Convert hybrid mode to rule references
- [ ] Validate converted modes match original output

**Phase 2.3: Mode Generation Pipeline** (5-8 hours)
- [ ] Integrate rule pool with mode generation
- [ ] Update deployment system to use rule-based modes
- [ ] Test full mode deployment with rule references
- [ ] Validate backward compatibility

**Phase 2.4: Mode Validation & Testing** (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for new mode system
- [ ] Validate all existing functionality works
- [ ] Performance testing for rule-based generation
- [ ] Documentation updates

**Estimated Phase 2 Total**: 20-31 hours

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. Create rule schema definition
2. Implement rule pool data structures
3. Begin rule extraction from existing modes
4. Test with small subset of rules

**Status**: Phase 1.1 In Progress
**Next Milestone**: Complete rule schema design
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for Phase 1.1
