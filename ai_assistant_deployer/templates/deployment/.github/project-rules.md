# üéØ Project Rules - Mode Selection State

## Current Status: Mode Selection Pending

This project is currently in **mode selection** state. Project-specific rules will be populated once you select your preferred AI assistant mode.

## Available Modes

- **Enterprise Mode**: Comprehensive rules for large-scale projects
- **Hybrid Mode**: Balanced approach for medium projects  
- **Simplified Mode**: Essential rules for quick prototypes
- **Custom Mode**: Tailored configuration based on specific needs

## How to Activate Rules

1. **Tell your AI assistant** which mode you prefer:
   - "I want Enterprise mode"
   - "Set up Hybrid mode for this project"
   - "Use Simplified mode"
   - "I need Custom mode configuration"

2. **Use the extension** (if installed):
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Type: `AI Assistant: Set Mode`
   - Select your mode

3. **Run the script manually**:
   ```bash
   ./mode-manager.sh [enterprise|hybrid|simplified|custom]
   ```

## What Happens After Mode Selection?

Once you select a mode, this file will be replaced with:
- Mode-specific coding standards
- Project structure guidelines
- Testing requirements
- Architecture patterns
- Best practices for your chosen approach

**‚è∞ Ready to get started?** Choose your mode using any of the methods above!
- **RELY ON**: Appropriate backup system based on situation

## Testing Requirements
### Coverage by Complexity
- **EASY (E)**: Basic validation only
- **MEDIUM (M)**: Unit + Widget tests required
- **HIGH (H)**: Unit + Widget + Integration tests required

### Test Types
- **UNIT**: Data layer business logic
- **WIDGET**: Presentation layer components  
- **INTEGRATION**: Auth flows and navigation
- **COVERAGE**: 70% critical paths minimum

## Refactoring Guidelines
### Safety-First Approach
- **BACKUP**: Editor auto-creates `.history/{path}/{filename}_{timestamp}.ext` backups
- **PRESERVE**: Move original files to `.legacy/{path}/{filename}.dart`
- **SUFFIX**: Create new files with `_refactored` or `_clean` suffix
- **GRADUAL**: Switch via imports gradually
- **INCREMENTAL**: Migration with full testing between steps
- **NEVER**: Delete originals until 100% confident in replacement

### Naming Conventions
- **`_refactored.dart`**: Improved version with same interface
- **`_clean.dart`**: Complete rewrite with simplified architecture
- **`.create()`**: Factory method standard for proper dependency injection
