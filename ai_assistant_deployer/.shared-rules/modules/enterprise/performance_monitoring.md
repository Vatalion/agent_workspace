# Enterprise Performance Monitoring Module

**Module ID**: `enterprise.performance_monitoring`  
**Dependencies**: `core.workflow_core`  
**Performance Impact**: Low (adds 0.2s startup)  
**Memory Usage**: ~5MB  

## Overview
This module implements comprehensive performance monitoring, metrics collection, and optimization standards for enterprise applications.

## Rules Consolidated
- **Rule #9**: Performance optimization standards
- **Rule #13**: Monitoring and alerting requirements
- **Rule #18**: System performance metrics

## Performance Standards

### Application Performance
- **Response Time**: 95th percentile < 200ms for API calls
- **Throughput**: Handle minimum required RPS with headroom
- **Memory Usage**: Stay within allocated limits with 20% buffer
- **CPU Utilization**: Target < 70% average, < 90% peak
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% for critical operations

### Database Performance
- **Query Performance**: No queries > 1s execution time
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management
- **Index Optimization**: Regular query plan analysis
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: > 95% for frequently accessed data

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **System Resources**: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network
- **Application Health**: Service availability, response times
- **Business Metrics**: User engagement, conversion rates
- **Security Events**: Failed logins, suspicious activities

## Monitoring Implementation

### Key Metrics Collection
```bash
# Performance metrics to track
- Response time percentiles (50th, 90th, 95th, 99th)
- Request rate and throughput
- Error rates by service/endpoint
- Database query performance
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Memory and CPU utilization
- Disk I/O and network usage
```

### Alerting Configuration
```bash
# Critical alerts (immediate response)
- Service downtime > 1 minute
- Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 1s for 5 minutes
- Memory usage > 90% for 10 minutes
- CPU usage > 90% for 15 minutes

# Warning alerts (investigate within 1 hour)
- Response time > 500ms for 15 minutes
- Error rate > 0.5% for 15 minutes
- Database connection pool > 80% for 10 minutes
```

### Performance Optimization Process

#### 1. Measurement

- Load testing
- Performance regression testing

## Dashboards & Reporting

### Real-time Dashboards
- **Executive Dashboard**: High-level KPIs and business metrics
- **Operations Dashboard**: System health and performance
- **Development Dashboard**: Application metrics and errors

### Regular Reports
- **Daily**: Performance summary, error analysis
- **Weekly**: Trend analysis, capacity planning
- **Monthly**: Performance review, optimization opportunities

## Performance Budget

### Define Limits
```yaml
performance_budget:
  page_load_time: 3s
  api_response_time: 200ms
