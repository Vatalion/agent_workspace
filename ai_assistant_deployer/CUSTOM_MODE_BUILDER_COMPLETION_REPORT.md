## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Key Files Modified:
1. **`src/ui/aiAssistantWebviewProvider.ts`**
   - Added Custom Mode Builder modal HTML and CSS
   - Implemented `openCustomModeBuilder()` public method
   - Added `deployCustomMode()` JavaScript function
   - Updated message handling for new message types
   - Fixed input field IDs for validation compatibility

2. **`src/services/modeDeployment.ts`**
   - Added `createInstructions()` method
   - Added `generateInstructionsContent()` helper method
   - Implemented proper template literal formatting
   - Integrated with existing deployment architecture

3. **`src/extension_control_center.ts`**
   - Command `customModeBuilder` already registered

### Features Implemented:
- **Interactive Mode Builder**: Full UI for creating custom modes
- **Rule Management**: Dynamic rule addition and configuration
- **Instruction Generation**: Automatic markdown instruction file creation
- **Deployment Integration**: Seamless integration with existing deployment system
- **Validation System**: Comprehensive testing and validation framework

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Open VS Code Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run command: `AI Assistant: Custom Mode Builder`
3. Fill in mode details in the modal:
   - Mode Name (required)
   - Description (required)
   - Target Project (optional)
