**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/modeConfigurationService.ts` - Removed hybrid mode definition (70+ lines)
- `src/services/modeGenerationPipeline.ts` - Removed hybrid content generation methods
- `src/services/modeConfigurationTypes.ts` - Updated type definitions to exclude 'hybrid'
- `src/services/modeMigrationService.ts` - Removed hybrid from migration arrays
- `src/services/modeGenerationIntegrationTest.ts` - Removed hybrid test configurations
- `src/services/modeDeployment.ts` - Updated deployment comments
- `src/services/ruleExtractionService.ts` - Removed hybrid tag extraction
- `src/ui/aiAssistantWebviewProvider.ts` - Removed hybrid UI options and logic

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No references to 'hybrid' found in codebase
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Extension packages successfully

### 2. Custom Mode Builder Implementation (100% Complete)

**Architecture Verified:**
- ✅ **UI Components** - Full modal implementation in `WebviewHtmlRenderer.ts`
- ✅ **Message Handling** - Complete routing in `WebviewMessageHandler.ts`
- ✅ **Rule Pool Integration** - `RulePoolService` integration in webview provider
- ✅ **Command Registration** - VS Code command palette integration
- ✅ **Deployment Workflow** - Integration with existing deployment system

**Key Components Implemented:**

#### UI Layer (`WebviewHtmlRenderer.ts`)
```typescript
- generateCustomModeBuilderModal() - Complete modal HTML
- Modal form elements: name, description, project type, rule selection
- JavaScript handlers: openCustomModeBuilder(), closeCustomModeBuilder()
- Message event listeners for communication with extension
```

#### Message Handling (`WebviewMessageHandler.ts`)
```typescript
- handleOpenCustomModeBuilder() - Opens modal interface
- handleLoadAvailableRules() - Loads rules from rule pool
- handleCreateCustomMode() - Creates custom mode configuration
- Complete message routing for all custom mode builder operations
```

#### Business Logic (`AIAssistantWebviewProvider.ts`)
```typescript
- openCustomModeBuilder() - Main entry point
- handleLoadAvailableRules() - Rule pool integration
- handleCreateCustomMode() - Mode creation with rule pool data
- RulePoolService integration for dynamic rule loading
```

#### VS Code Integration (`extension.ts`)
```typescript
- Command: 'aiAssistantDeployer.customModeBuilder'
- Command palette: "AI Assistant: Custom Mode Builder"
- Integration with existing webview provider
```

### 3. Rule Pool System Integration

**Verified Components:**
- ✅ `RulePoolService` - Complete rule management system
- ✅ Dynamic rule loading from `data/rules/rule-pool.json`
- ✅ Rule filtering by category, urgency, and other criteria
- ✅ Rule selection interface with checkboxes
- ✅ Custom mode generation with selected rules

### 4. Testing & Validation

**Updated Validation System:**
- ✅ Fixed validation script to check correct file locations
- ✅ All validation tests pass (4/4)
- ✅ UI Components: PASS
- ✅ Message Handling: PASS
- ✅ Deployment Workflow: PASS
- ✅ File Generation: PASS
