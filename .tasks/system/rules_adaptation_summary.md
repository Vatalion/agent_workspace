# Project Organization Rules Adaptation - Summary

## Changes Implemented

### Task Management System
- Created required subdirectories in `.tasks/` folder
  - `epics/` for long-term initiatives
  - `completed/` for finished tasks
  - `system/` for configuration
- Created `ACTIVE_TASK.md` for current task details
- Updated `current.json` with new task format

### Feature-Based Architecture
- Created feature-based directory structure in `lib/`
  - Example 'home' feature with proper clean architecture structure
  - Core directories for common utilities and constants
  - Shared directories for cross-feature components

### Documentation
- Added `REFACTORING_PROTOCOL.md` with safety-first refactoring guidelines
- Added `PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md` with benchmarks and quality gates
- Created `docs/task-management/TASK_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` for the task system
- Updated `project-rules.md` with new organizational standards

### Validation & Migration Tools
- Created `scripts/validate_project_structure.sh` for structure validation
- Created `scripts/migrate_to_feature_architecture.sh` to facilitate migration
- Updated project map with new directory structure

## Compliance Status
- ✅ `.github/` folder structure complies with security protocol (7 files + 1 directory)
- ✅ Task management system follows new organizational rules
- ✅ Directory structure follows feature-based clean architecture
- ✅ Documentation properly organized in designated locations

## Next Steps
1. Migrate existing code to feature-based structure
2. Add needed BLoCs in their proper locations
3. Implement performance monitoring based on new standards
4. Follow refactoring protocol for gradual improvements
