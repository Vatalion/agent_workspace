# Active Task

## Current Status: Completed
**Task**: Adopting Comprehensive Project Organization Rules

## Task Details
- **Type**: Organization/Rule Implementation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes
- **Files Affected**: .github/ folder, project structure validation

## Completed Actions
- ✅ **Security Protocol Compliance**: Verified .github/ folder contains exactly 7 files + 1 subdirectory as required
- ✅ **Fixed Validation Script**: Corrected validate_security.sh to use dynamic project path instead of hardcoded path
- ✅ **Created Required Directories**: Added .temp/ and .legacy/ folders for new backup and temporary file protocols
- ✅ **Verified Architecture Compliance**: Confirmed Flutter app already follows feature-based architecture rules
- ✅ **Updated Documentation**: All copilot-instructions.md and project-rules.md are aligned with comprehensive new standards
- ✅ **Validated Structure**: Project map shows compliant structure with proper separation of concerns

## Key Achievements
- **📋 .github/ Folder Security**: MAXIMUM 7 FILES + 1 SUBDIRECTORY rule enforced
- **🔒 Security Validation**: Working validation script prevents future violations
- **📁 Directory Structure**: All required folders (.temp/, .legacy/, .history/) in place
- **🏗️ Architecture**: Feature-based structure with proper BLoC placement already implemented
- **📖 Documentation**: Comprehensive rules covering all aspects of development workflow

## Summary
Successfully adopted all new comprehensive project organization rules. The project now follows:
- Strict .github/ folder security protocol
- 15-step mandatory workflow process
- Feature-based architecture with clean separation
- Pure function standards (max 20 lines, no side effects)
- Documentation hierarchy with no redundancy
- Performance benchmarks and quality gates
- Safety protocols with dual backup system (.history/ + .legacy/)
- Task management integration protocols

The project is now fully compliant and ready for development following the new comprehensive standards.
