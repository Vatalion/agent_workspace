# AI Agent Helper Development Tools

This repository is part of a comprehensive collection of **AI Agent Helper Development Tools** - specialized utilities, servers, and integrations designed to enhance AI-powered development workflows and provide intelligent assistance for modern software development.

## üéØ Project Vision

Building the future of AI-assisted software development through specialized tools that bridge the gap between human developers and AI systems. Our tools enable real-time collaboration, intelligent error handling, automated debugging, and context-aware development assistance.

## üöÄ Current Project: Flutter Error Transport MCP Server

### Overview
A production-ready **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** specifically designed for Flutter application development. This server creates a real-time pipeline between Flutter runtime errors and AI systems, enabling immediate intelligent debugging assistance and proactive error resolution.

### Key Capabilities
- **Real-time Error Streaming**: Captures Flutter runtime errors with full context and streams them to AI systems
- **Intelligent Error Categorization**: Automatically classifies errors into 8 specialized categories (widget_build, state_management, navigation, http_api, platform_channel, memory_performance, framework, general)
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Provides root cause analysis, debugging steps, and fix suggestions through AI integration
- **Flutter-Specific Intelligence**: Deep understanding of Flutter widget lifecycle, state management patterns, and mobile app architecture
- **Production-Ready Integration**: Easy integration with existing Flutter error monitoring and development workflows

### Technical Excellence
- **TypeScript + MCP Protocol**: Built with strict TypeScript and follows MCP specifications
- **Comprehensive Error Context**: Captures device info, user actions, widget hierarchy, and app state
- **Zod Validation**: Type-safe error data validation and processing
- **Development Environment**: Complete VS Code integration with tasks, debugging, and CI/CD
