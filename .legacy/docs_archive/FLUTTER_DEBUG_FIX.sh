echo "   - Press F5 (Start Debugging)"
echo "   - OR: Ctrl+Shift+D ‚Üí Click play button"
echo "   - Select: 'Flutter Debug Assistant Test'"
echo ""
echo "3. Verify Debug Console is active:"
echo "   - View ‚Üí Debug Console"
echo "   - Should show Flutter startup messages"
echo ""
echo "4. Test error detection:"
echo "   - In Flutter app: Tap 'üî• Trigger Console Errors'"
echo "   - Should see: Notifications with 'ü§ñ Fix This Error' buttons"
echo ""

echo "üîç WHY THIS MATTERS:"
echo "   ‚úì VS Code Debug Console = Extension can monitor"
