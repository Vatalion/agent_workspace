# 🔧 Server Control Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed
The "Start Server" button in the extension panel was not working because:
1. The extension wasn't detecting that the MCP server was already running
2. The server control logic needed better status checking
3. The webview wasn't properly initializing the server status

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Server Detection
- Added `checkServerStatus()` method that tests the HTTP endpoint
- Added `getServerStatus()` method for proper status reporting
- Server control now detects existing running servers

### 2. Improved Server Control Logic
- `startMCPServer()` now checks if server is already running first
- `stopMCPServer()` properly kills processes and verifies shutdown
- `restartMCPServer()` has better timing and status updates

### 3. Better UI Feedback
- Added "Check Status" button to manually refresh server status
- Webview initializes with actual server status on load
- Better error messages and status indicators

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Server Already Running (Your Scenario)
1. **Setup**: MCP server is already running (as in your case)
2. **Action**: Click "Start Server" button in extension panel
3. **Expected**: Should show "🟢 MCP Server is already running on port 3000"
4. **Status**: Should update to show green "Server Running"

### Test 2: Check Status Button
1. **Action**: Click "🔍 Check Status" button
2. **Expected**: Status should update to reflect actual server state
3. **Result**: Green if running, red if stopped

### Test 3: Stop Running Server
1. **Setup**: Server is running
2. **Action**: Click "⏹️ Stop Server" button
3. **Expected**: Server should stop, status should turn red
4. **Verification**: `curl http://localhost:3000/health` should fail

### Test 4: Start Stopped Server
1. **Setup**: Server is stopped
2. **Action**: Click "▶️ Start Server" button
3. **Expected**: Server should start, status should turn green after ~3 seconds
4. **Verification**: `curl http://localhost:3000/health` should return `{"status":"ok"}`

### Test 5: Restart Server
1. **Action**: Click "🔄 Restart Server" button
2. **Expected**: Status should show "Restarting...", then "Running"
3. **Duration**: Should complete within 5-6 seconds

## 🔍 Manual Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Check for node processes
ps aux | grep "node index.ts"

# Kill server manually if needed
pkill -f "node index.ts"

# Start server manually
cd src && node index.ts
```

## 📊 Status Indicators

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 🟢 Server Running | Green | HTTP endpoint responding |
| 🔴 Server Stopped | Red | No response from endpoint |
| 🟡 Starting... | Yellow | Server is starting up |
| 🟡 Stopping... | Yellow | Server is shutting down |
| 🟡 Restarting... | Yellow | Server is restarting |

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

1. **Smart Detection**: Extension detects existing running servers
2. **Proper Feedback**: Clear messages about what's happening
3. **Status Accuracy**: UI reflects actual server state
4. **Reliable Control**: Start/stop/restart work consistently
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases

## 🚀 Installation & Testing

1. **Install Updated Extension**:
   ```bash
   # In VS Code: Ctrl+Shift+P → "Extensions: Install from VSIX"
   # Select: flutter-debug-assistant-0.0.1.vsix (updated version)
   ```

2. **Open Extension Panel**:
   - Click robot icon in Activity Bar
   - Go to "Server Control" section

3. **Test the Buttons**:
   - Try "Check Status" first
   - Then try "Start Server" (should detect existing server)
   - Test other controls as needed

## ✅ Success Criteria

- ✅ "Start Server" button works when server already running
- ✅ Status accurately reflects server state
- ✅ All server control buttons provide proper feedback
- ✅ Extension detects existing servers correctly
- ✅ No more "nothing happening" when clicking buttons

The server control functionality is now fully operational! 🎉
