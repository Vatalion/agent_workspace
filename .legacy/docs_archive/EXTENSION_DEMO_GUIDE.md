# 🎯 Flutter Debug Assistant - What It Can Do & How to Test

## 🚀 **WHAT THE EXTENSION DOES**

The Flutter Debug Assistant is an AI-powered VS Code extension that helps you debug Flutter applications by:

1. **🔍 Automatic Error Detection** - Monitors your Flutter terminal output in real-time
2. **🤖 AI Integration** - Sends errors and code to AI for instant debugging help
3. **📋 Context Capture** - Captures stack traces, file paths, and error details
4. **⚡ Quick Actions** - Right-click menus and command palette integration
5. **🐛 Debug Session Integration** - Works with VS Code's debugger

## 🧪 **STEP-BY-STEP TESTING GUIDE**

### **Phase 1: Basic Extension Features**

#### **Test 1: Command Palette Integration**
```bash
1. Press Cmd+Shift+P (Command Palette)
2. Type "Flutter Debug"
3. You should see these commands:
   • 🤖 Flutter Debug Assistant: Send Error to AI
   • 🤖 Flutter Debug Assistant: Send Debug Context to AI
   • 🤖 Flutter Debug Assistant: Send Terminal Output to AI
   • ⚙️ Flutter Debug Assistant: Flutter Debug Assistant Settings
```

**✅ Expected Result**: All 4 commands appear in the palette

#### **Test 2: Right-Click Context Menus**
```bash
1. Open VS Code with the Flutter project
2. Navigate to lib/error_examples.dart
3. Right-click anywhere in the code
4. Look for these menu items:
   • 🤖 Send Error to AI
   • 🤖 Send Debug Context to AI
   • 🤖 Send Terminal Output to AI
```

**✅ Expected Result**: AI commands appear in right-click menu

---

### **Phase 2: Error Detection Testing**

#### **Test 3: Widget Build Error Detection**
```bash
1. Make sure Flutter app is running on simulator
2. In the Flutter app, tap "Widget Build Errors"
3. Tap "RenderFlex Overflow Error"
4. Watch VS Code terminal for error output
5. Right-click in VS Code → "Send Error to AI"
```

**✅ Expected Result**: Extension detects overflow error and captures context

#### **Test 4: State Management Error**
```bash
1. In Flutter app, tap "State Management Errors"
2. Tap "setState After Dispose"
3. Observe VS Code terminal for error
4. Use Command Palette → "Send Terminal Output to AI"
```

**✅ Expected Result**: setState error is detected and captured

#### **Test 5: Navigation Error**
```bash
1. Tap "Navigation Errors" in Flutter app
2. Tap "Invalid Route Navigation"
3. Check VS Code terminal
4. Try right-click → "Send Error to AI"
```

**✅ Expected Result**: Navigation error context is captured

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**

#### **Test 6: Debug Session Integration**
```bash
1. In VS Code, press F5 to start debugging
2. Set a breakpoint in lib/error_examples.dart (line 50-100)
3. Trigger an error in the Flutter app
4. When debugger pauses, right-click → "Send Debug Context to AI"
```

**✅ Expected Result**: Debug context includes stack trace and variable states

#### **Test 7: HTTP/API Error Detection**
```bash
1. In Flutter app, tap "HTTP/API Errors"
2. Tap "Network Timeout Error"
3. Watch VS Code terminal for network error
4. Test extension's HTTP error detection
```

**✅ Expected Result**: Network errors are properly captured

---

### **Phase 4: AI Integration**

#### **Test 8: Error Analysis Prompts**
```bash
1. Trigger any error from the Flutter app
2. Right-click in VS Code → "Send Error to AI"
3. Check what prompt/context is generated
4. Verify it includes:
   • Error message
   • Stack trace
   • File path
   • Code snippet
   • Debugging suggestions request
```

**✅ Expected Result**: Comprehensive AI prompt with all error context
