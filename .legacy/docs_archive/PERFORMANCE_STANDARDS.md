# Performance & Quality Standards

This document outlines the performance benchmarks and quality gates that our project must meet.

## Performance Benchmarks

### Critical Performance Metrics
- **STARTUP TIME**: <2s cold start (must be maintained)
- **NAVIGATION**: <300ms between screens (critical user experience)
- **MEMORY USAGE**: <100MB baseline (monitor growth)
- **APP SIZE**: Track and control app size growth
- **FRAME RATES**: Maintain 60fps during normal operation
- **CRASH RATE**: <1% crash rate in production

### Monitoring Methods
- Use Flutter DevTools for profiling
- Implement crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics or equivalent)
- Regular performance audits in CI pipeline
- Memory leak detection with Flutter Memory Profiler

## Quality Gates

### Mandatory Quality Checks
- **BUILD VALIDATION**: iOS/Android builds must pass completely
- **TEST COVERAGE**: 70% critical paths minimum coverage
- **ANALYSIS**: `flutter analyze` must pass with zero errors
- **PERFORMANCE**: Frame rate profiling for complex screens
- **MEMORY**: Memory leak detection and profiling
- **CRASH TRACKING**: Implement comprehensive crash tracking

### Automated Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic and usecases
- Widget tests for critical UI components
- Integration tests for main user flows
- Performance regression tests

## Implementation Guidelines

### Performance Optimization
- Use const constructors where possible
- Implement proper list virtualization (ListView.builder)
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Minimize widget rebuilds with proper state management
- Use BuildContext extension methods for responsive design

### Memory Management
- Dispose controllers and subscriptions properly
- Cache only necessary data
- Clear image caches when low on memory
- Use weak references for non-critical cached objects
- Implement proper stream management and disposal

## Monitoring Plan

### Continuous Monitoring
- Implement performance tracing in staging/production
- Track CPU, memory, and render times
- Automated alerts for regressions
- Weekly performance reports

### User Experience Metrics
- Track time to interactive
- Monitor gesture-to-response latency
- Track ANRs (Application Not Responding)
- Monitor battery consumption
